## 🏭 AtliQ Computer Hardware Manufacturing Data Analysis (2018–2022, 1.8M+ Records)

This project is an end-to-end data analysis of AtliQ Hardware’s manufacturing and sales data (2018–2022, 1.8M+ records).

The goal was to provide unified insights across Finance, Sales, Marketing, and Supply Chain to support better strategic decisions.

## 🔧 Tech Stack

- **Programming & Libraries:** Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn)  
- **Database:** MySQL (Advanced Queries, Summaries, Indexing)  
- **Visualization & Modeling:** Power BI (Snowflake Schema, DAX, DAX Studio Optimization)  


## 📂 Project Workflow
- **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing** – handled missing values, and performed integration using Pandas.  
- **SQL Analysis** – generated business summaries (Profit, Sales, Margins), advanced aggregations, and optimized queries for large datasets.  
- **Data Modeling (Snowflake Schema)** – created dim_date table and designed fact and dimension tables to create a scalable and efficient Power BI data model.
-  **Power BI Dashboard** – built interactive dashboards for:
  - Finance (P&L, Margin Tracking)  
  - Sales (Customer Performance, Region-wise Sales)  
  - Marketing (Campaign Impact, Product Trends)  
  - Supply Chain (Inventory, Demand Fulfillment)  
  - Executive View (Unified KPIs)  
- **Machine Learning Applications** –  Discount Anomaly Detection, Customer Segmentation (Clustering), Recommendation System for product

## Insights
Here are some key insights from the analysis:  

- 📉 Healthy gross margin, but negative net profit → need to prioritize reducing high operating expenses.  
- 🌍 India and USA are the top markets, with South Korea emerging as a strong growth region.  
- 💵 A reasonable portion of sales is retained after applying discounts, indicating effective pricing strategies.  
- 💻 Notebooks are the highest-demand products, followed by Peripherals.
